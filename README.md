# AnalysisCode
Repo for code to analyse GoAT files. Basic analysis developed by Prof. D. Watts and Dr. L. Zana originally. Anaysis functionality extended and developed by KP.

Note: this code won't actually run by itself, it needs the GoAT framework available from the A2 collaboration github (https://github.com/A2-Collaboration-dev/a2GoAT).
